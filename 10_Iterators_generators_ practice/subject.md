### **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Pipeline**

**The Goal:**    
You need to process a real-time, "infinite" stream of stock market data. You need to build a pipeline that generates data, filters it on the fly, and feeds it into a state-aware decision engine.
Build a memory-efficient processing pipeline using **Generators**, **Generator Expressions**, and **Coroutines**.
